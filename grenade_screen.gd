extends Node

# idea: (grenade screen)

# start with the intro:
# objective: catch grenades,
# jump in front of trains, etc.

# end screen: character falls to ground
# (from wherever player had them once they caught
# the last item),
# character looks more beaten up
# little arrow or some kind of signal to move the
# character (like a platform) to the right side
# of the screen (using arrow keys)
# character moves off screen to next scene


# 24k magic idea:

# character looks classy, signal to move arrow keys
# right to jump into pile of gold
# (looks like leprachaun)
# jumping in catapults character into sky
# (like in desert in mario)
# new background: gold coins
# catch martinis, gold bars, dollar bills, little yachts
# 24k magic plays in background
# after collecting:
# character flies upwards from last place
# player moved it to UFO that appears
# (under blue spotlight), once centered under
# character moves behind UFO (disappears)
# UFO flies up (out of screen)
# spotlight (screen turns black except for
# little circle / like in cartoons)
# or some other transition

# world is ending scren
# platformers
# wasteland type
# transition: UFO appears and drops player
# player has to collect cowboy hats, lassos
# (western theme: ribs)
# at end, animation (like ending of mario levels
# but instead of a castle it's a spaceship)
# that goes up off screen
# then the player gets jumpscared by an
# end screen reminiscent of duaa's love
# calculator game but with a blown up
